Description: This R package allows users to remove NA values from the entire dataset of choice if the dataset 
              character of choice is not specifically "NA", or if the values are NA. It also plots two columns from the 
              dataset of choice into a line plot through ggplot2, then plotting both a numerical and a categorical predictor with
              a response as a linear regression plot.
