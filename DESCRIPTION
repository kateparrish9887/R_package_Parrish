Description: This R package allows users to remove NA values from an entire dataset if the dataset contains non-NA values for missing values, 
              or if the values are NA. This package can also visualize a minimum and maximum value column against a categorical column from a dataset 
              into a line range plot through ggplot2. Lastly, this package can be used to plot a numerical response and predictor as a linear model, 
              with an (optional) additional categorical predictor distinguished by color.
